Summary:

Key objectives were outlined, including a review of previous action items and finalizing technical assessment requirements. Nto Vinkhumbo confirmed that the IT manager would share documentation related to the K2 application, emphasizing the need for coordination with the IT team. Mahmood Lockhat reported he had not yet contacted MTN regarding SMS gateway settings but planned to do so soon.

The discussion highlighted the necessity for clear communication and documentation sharing among team members, leading to a proposal by a conference room participant to create a WhatsApp group for quick communication, which was supported by Nto and Peter Thembane.
